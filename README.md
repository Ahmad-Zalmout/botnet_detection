# Botnet Detection using ML

Botnets impose a very big threat to individuals and organizations as they are used to inaugurate 
different types of cyber-attacks such as phishing, denial-of-service (DOS) distributed denial
of-service (DDoS), or spamming. An intruder can use any security vulnerability as an access 
point for a botnet. Since every botnet is set up in a unique way, it is very hard to detect. 
Furthermore, intruders make sure that their victims are oblivious to the attacks.  
To be able to detect and prevent botnets would definitely help make networks more secure and 
protect devices that are connected to the internet. This project aims to use machine-learning 
techniques in order to detect botnets by analyzing different features extracted to help prevent 
malicious activity.
